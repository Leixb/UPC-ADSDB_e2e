% Add an explanation of how you have organized your operations. Specifically,
% pay special attention to justify the new code added to orchestrate the pieces
% generated during development.

% For items 3, 4 and 5, it is important you discuss the pros and cons of your
% chosen solution. We will positively assess if you identify the limitations of
% your current approach (do not worry to state them, it is a baseline, simple
% solution, it will have plenty ). Do not repeat here the information in the
% notebooks / code. These should be an overall description to understand your
% development and operations platform and facilitate the supervisor to explore
% it.
